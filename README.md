## Factors Influencing Student Exam Performance: Multi-Model Analysis

Understanding the factors that influence student performance is critical for designing effective interventions to improve academic outcomes. Factors such as study habits, parental involvement, attendance, prior achievement, access to tutoring, and parental education levels all contribute to academic success, but their relative importance and interactions remain unclear. This study aims to address this gap by investigating the drivers of exam scores using a dataset of 6,607 records and 20 features, including exam scores, attendance, study habits, and parental involvement.

This research employs a comprehensive methodology to uncover patterns and relationships in the data. Correlation analysis, heatmaps and other visualizations will identify initial relationships among variables. Regression models will quantify the combined effects of predictors, such as hours studied, attendance, and parental involvement, on exam scores. Bayesian models will integrate prior knowledge, such as the relationship between exam scores and previous performance, to refine predictions. Poisson models will provide insights into count data, such as tutoring sessions. Through these techniques, we aim to identify the most significant predictors and understand the interactions among them.

The findings from this research are expected to provide actionable insights. Key insights include the relationship between study time, attendance, and exam scores; the impact of parental involvement and education on student success; and the role of academic resources, such as tutoring, in improving performance. These results will guide the design of targeted interventions, enabling more equitable learning opportunities and resource allocation.

By using a multi-faceted analytical approach, this research seeks to answer critical questions about the drivers of student success, providing a robust foundation for improving academic outcomes in diverse educational settings.
